# Abled Twenty Fourteen

"Abled Twenty Fourteen has all of the features as the default Twenty Fourteen WordPress Theme, as far as I've tested -- which isn't as far as it should be to qualify such a statement -- and is hopefully a little more robust when it comes to accessibility concerns."

## Features

Essentially all these "features" are is additions to the Twenty Fourteen theme that either help me maintain the theme or make what I feel are stronger statements toward accessibility.

- Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets (Sass) functionality.
- Category and Tag context helpers. More information to help users understand the words appearing above post titles and to the left off post tags are in fact categories and tags respectively, which the post has been filed under.
- A more descriptive 'read more' link on the index, archive and search pages to give the user more information as to what they're going to read more of should they follow the link.
- Forced hyphenation -- as hyphenation *may* prove to add difficulty from some users when reading. 
- The 'page title' and 'site description' appear together in the mark-up providing users using a "less-traditional" means of access, like a screen reader for instance, a less disjointed experience.
- More semantically structured headings (h1 being the most important heading on a page and h6 being the least, while everything else being graded in between).
