# Access Must Be Abled

This repository contains an entire WordPress installation and a customized version of the 2014 default theme TwentyFourteen, cleverly re-named Abled TwentyFourteen. So the over arching point of this project is to tweak the inclusive features of the TwentyFourteen theme towards the better. But with the added benefit -- or goal -- to allow open criticism, transparent discussion and hopefully an opportunity to learn from mistakes. Hence the title of this repo; Access Must Be Abled.

## Abled TwentyFourteen Features

Essentially all these "features" are is additions to the Twenty Fourteen theme that either help me maintain the theme or make what I feel are stronger statements toward accessibility.

- Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets (Sass) functionality.
- "Context helpers". More and better placed information to help users, screen reader users specifically, understand to what and where certain phrases/ links belong. For example, the words appearing above post titles and to the left off post tags are in fact categories and tags respectively, which the post has been filed under.
- A more descriptive 'read more' link on the index, archive and search pages to give the user more information as to what they're going to read more of should they follow the link.
- Forced un-hyphenation -- as hyphenation *may* prove to add difficulty from some users when reading. 
- The 'page title' and 'site description' appear together in the mark-up providing non-visual users a less disjointed experience.
- More semantically structured headings (h1 being the most important heading on a page and h6 being the least, while everything else being graded in between).
