# Abled Twenty Fourteen

"Abled Twenty Fourteen has all of the features as the default Twenty Fourteen WordPress Theme, as far as I've tested -- which isn't as far as it should be to qualify such a statement -- and is hopefully a little more robust when it comes to accessibility concerns."

## Features

Essentially all these "features" are is additions to the Twenty Fourteen theme that either help me maintain the theme or make what I feel are stronger statements toward accessibility.

- Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets (Sass) functionality.
