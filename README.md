# Abled Twenty Fourteen

"Abled Twenty Fourteen has all of the features as the default Twenty Fourteen WordPress Theme, as far as I've tested -- which isn't as far as it should be to qualify such a statement -- and is hopefully a little more robust when it comes to accessibility concerns."

## Features

Essentially all these "features" are is additions to the Twenty Fourteen theme that either help me maintain the theme or make what I feel are stronger statements toward accessibility.

- Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets (Sass) functionality.
- Category context helpers. More information to help users understand the words appearing above a post titles are in fact categories which the post has been filed under. Simply accomplished addition of the words 'categorized under'.
- A more descriptive 'read more' link on the index, archive and search pages to give the user more information as to what they're going to read more of should they follow the link.
