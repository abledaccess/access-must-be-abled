Theme Name: Abled Twenty Fourteen

Author: Johnny Taylor

Description: Abled Twenty Fourteen has all of the features as the default Twenty Fourteen Theme, or as far as I've tested (which isn't as far as it should be to qualify such a statement), but it's a little more robust when it comes to accessibility concerns.
